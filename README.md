## Devaluation Task

This repository contains code to run a devaluation task for web-based testing.

<strong>Fear-conditioning and avoidance learning task.</strong>
Task includes three phases: 1) Learning/Acquisition, 2) Response and 3) Extinction/Recall.

<strong>Phase 1:</strong> Multiple stimuli are linked to differing levels of aversive feedback probability (CS+), with two stimuli associated with a high probability of aversive feedback (80%) and two with a low probability of aversive feedback (20%). Participants will view a series of trials to learn these contingencies and report their estimated guess of the contingencies at the end of the phase.

<strong>Phase 2:</strong> Participants are given the choice to “avoid” the outcome of the viewed stimuli linked to the stimuli by pressing the SPACEBAR key. Choosing to avoid will result in milder aversive feedback. Thus, for the low probability aversive stimuli, choosing to avoid is more detrimental.

<strong>Phase 3:</strong> One high and one low aversive CS+ is devalued in this phase and participants are explicitly told about this. As such, choosing to avoid the devalued stimuli is more harmful. Participants will report their estimated guess of the contingencies at the end of the phase again.

To ensure participants are paying attention throughout the task, some trials will require the pressing of the O key when a neutral tone is played.
