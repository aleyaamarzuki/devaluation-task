<strong>Differential fear-conditioning and avoidance learning task.</strong>
Task includes two phases: 1) Acquisition and 2) Extinction and recall.

<strong>Phase 1:</strong> Multiple stimuli are linked to differing levels of aversive feedback probability (CS+), with two stimuli associated with a high probability of aversive feedback (80%) and two with a low probability of aversive feedback (10%). Participants are given the choice to “avoid” the outcome of the viewed stimuli with one out of two response keys (which they have to learn) linked to the stimuli. Choosing to avoid (e.g. pressing a response key, even if it is the right key) will result in a chance of 20% to receive aversive feedback. Thus, for the low aversive stimuli, choosing to avoid is more detrimental. To ensure participants are paying attention throughout the task, some trials will require the pressing of a third key when a neutral tone is played.

<strong>Phase 2:</strong> One high and one low aversive CS+ is devalued in this phase and participants are explicitly told about this. As such, choosing to avoid the devalued stimuli is more harmful. On some trials, participants are also informed that response keys do not work (i.e. none of the keys will allow avoidance). This allows the identification of participants who are performing the task in a habitual manner.
